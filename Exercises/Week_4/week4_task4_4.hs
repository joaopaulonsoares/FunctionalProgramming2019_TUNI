4. Use the types and functions you have created in the previous tasks in this task.

Make a record that contains simple phone book entry information:
Name
Phone

Suppose we have a list of phone book entries. Make functions to:

-Find a list of entries by a name. (All entries where the name is the given one)

-Add a new entry, given a string for the name, the three strings for the phone like in Task 4.3 and the list of phone book entries to add the new entry to.
If there already exists an entry with the given name and the given number(phoneNo field in Phone), then make no change.

Note: Make sure not to import your answer for Task4.3 or Task4.2 in your answer for this task, since in peer-reviewing the file will not be present. (You will need to copy-paste)
